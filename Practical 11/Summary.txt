Summary:
The score for alignment in human and mouse DLX5 sequence is: 1490
The score for alignment in human DLX5 and random sequence is: -351
The score for alignment in mouse DLX5 and random sequence is: -348
The identical percentage of DLX5 in human and random sequence is: 0.02768166089965398
The identical percentage of DLX5 in mouse and random sequence is: 0.031141868512110725
The identical percentage of DLX5 in mouse and in human is: 0.9653979238754326
This program utilizes BLOSUM62 to do the alignment of amino acid sequence.
To avoid using difficult matrix, we can turn it into a dataframe format and take out value from index and column
For the similarity, we align the amino acid one to one, and calculate the identical percentage
From the result we can find that the similarity between human and mouse DLX5 is very high (near 97%). The alignment score of human and mouse sequence is large also suggest the same idea.
It means that through evolution the amino acid does change, influcing protein structure and function. However, their similarity to a random sequence is very small().
